## Projects
Below are in-progress and finished projects.

### 1. Numbers

#### 1.1 [Find PI to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/nix-life/Small-Projects/blob/main/numbers/pi.java)
Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal
places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

#### 1.2 [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/nix-life/Small-Projects/blob/main/numbers/fibonacci.java)
Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that
number or to the Nth number.

#### 1.3 [Prime Factorization](https://github.com/nix-life/Small-Projects/blob/main/numbers/prime_factorization.java)
Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and
display them.
